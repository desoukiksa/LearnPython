    "    1. You can only move one disk at the time.\n",
    "    2. You can only take the top disk and place on top of another tower (rod).\n",
    "    3. You cannot place a bigger disk on top of a smaller disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first two rules combined means that you can only take one top disk and move it.\n",
    "\n",
